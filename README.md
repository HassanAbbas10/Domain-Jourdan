# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


Go to project directory "RRTS" write "npm install" to install dependencies and write "npm run dev" to start the Project.

I made this Template because i was too lazy to always configure or install Tailwind,Shad Cn and making routes So i thought maybe some of my fellow devs Feel the Same way ðŸŽƒ

==============================>NOTE/ADVICE<==============================

This template is not for the New Devs
Those devs that **DON'T KNOW HOW TO**
1.  install tailwind in react 
2.  make Routes using react-router-dom.
3. install and configure ShadCn for React Project

Because Our goals As a developer is to always  learn and there are no shortcuts
So first learn how to to do Above and then Feel freely to use this template
